# PROSAIL-based Reflectance and Radiance Inversion Package

This package implements a PROSAIL-based reflectance or radiance inversion. It utilizes a least-squares fitting approach to optimize PROSAIL model parameters against measured reflectance data. The reflectance output can also serve as a forward model for use in radiance inversion processes, enabling accurate retrieval of physical properties from observed data.
